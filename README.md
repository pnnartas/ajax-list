AJAX List
=========

Brings AJAX to your lists and tables. Paginate, sort and interact with collection of items without reloading the page.

Features
--------

* *List pagination and sorting.*
* *Manipulating items: adding, deleting and editing.*
* *Displaing additional information by click.*
  For large lists, it is not very practical to show every detail about every item right from the start. With AJAX List, detailed information can be requested and displayed after click on the item.
* *Saving state in URL.*
  When list is modified by user, for example after user changes the sorting order of items, URL is changed too, to reflect the current state. Because of that, any state of the list can be accessed by saving direct link to the page. Individual items have URLs too.
* *Smart defaults.*
  In 90% cases there is zero JS needed inside HTML file. Just include the main JS file and add parameters to tags to use it.
* *Developed as a JQuery plugin.*
* *Compatible with Twitter's Bootstrap.*
  LESS files are provided for hardcore Bootstrap users to compile as extension and be as DRY as possible. Everyone else can use stand-alone CSS to make lists look good from the start.
