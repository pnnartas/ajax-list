AJAX List
=========

Brings AJAX to your lists and tables. Paginate, sort and interact with collection of items without reloading the page.

Features:
---------
* *List pagination and sorting.*
* *Manipulating items: add, delete and edit.*
* *Display additional information by click*
  If your list is large, it is not very practical to show every detail about every item right from the start. With AJAX List detailed information can be requested and displayed after click on the item.
* *Saving state in URL.*
  When you modify the list, for example by changing the sorting order of items, URL is changed to reflect the current state. Because of that, you can access any state of the list by saving direct link to page URL. Also, individual items can be accessed directly.
* *Smart defaults.*
  In 90% cases there is zero JS needed in your HTML file. Just include the main JS file and add few parameters to your tags to use it.
* *Developed as a JQuery plugin.*
* *Compatible with Twitter's Bootstrap.*
